/**
   A hash table.

   This is an open addressing hash table that stores pointers to arbitrary user
   data.  Internally, everything is stored in a single flat array that is
   resized when necessary.

   The single user-provided pointer that is stored in the table is called a
   "record".  A record contains a "key", which is accessed via a user-provided
   function.  This design supports storing large records (which may be
   expensive to allocate/construct) without requiring an entire record to
   search.  Simple atomic values can be stored by providing a trivial identity
   function as a key function.

   The table uses power of 2 sizes with a growth factor of 2, so that hash
   values can be folded into an array index using bitwise AND as a fast modulo.
   This means that only the necessary low bits of the hash value will be used,
   so the hash function must be well-balanced within this range.  More or less
   any good modern hash algorithm will be fine, but beware, for example, hash
   functions that assume they are targeting a table with a prime size.

   Since this doubles and halves in size, it may not be an optimal choice if
   memory reuse is a priority.  A growth factor of 1.5 with fast range
   reduction may be a better choice there, at the cost of requiring 128-bit
   arithmetic on 64-bit platforms, and indexing operations being slightly more
   expensive.

   This is an advanced low-level version of zix_hash_plan_insert().  It allows
   a precalculated hash code to be given, along with a custom search predicate.
   These must be compatible with the functions that manage the hash table:
   trivial usage would be to pass the equality function used by the hash and
   the key to search for.

   This is exposed to make it possible to avoid constructing a key at all when
   potentially inserting.  For example, if keys are structures with a fixed
   header and a variably-sized body, and you have a separate header and body
   this can be used to find an insert position without having to allocate a
   contiguous key.

   Note that care must be taken when using this function: improper use can
   corrupt the hash table.  The hash code given must be correct for the key to
   be inserted, and the predicate must return true only if the key it is called
   with (the first argument) matches the key to be inserted.
