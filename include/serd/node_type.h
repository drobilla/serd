   Type of a node.

   An RDF node, in the abstract sense, can be either a resource, literal, or a
   blank.  This type is more precise, because syntactically there are two ways
   to refer to a resource (by URI or CURIE).

   There are also two ways to refer to a blank node in syntax (by ID or
   anonymously), but this is handled by statement flags rather than distinct
   node types.
