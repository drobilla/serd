Command-Line Tools
##################

Serd includes several tools that can be used to process data on the command-line.
Each is documented by their own man page:

 * @SERD_PIPE_LINK@ is a streaming tool for reading and writing documents.

 * @SERD_SORT_LINK@ is similar to serd-pipe, but loads data into an in-memory model instead of streaming.

 * @SERD_FILTER_LINK@ is a ``grep``-like statement filtering tool.
