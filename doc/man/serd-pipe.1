.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a fast command-line utility for streaming and processing RDF data.
It reads one or more RDF documents and writes the data to stdout,
possibly transformed and/or in a different syntax.
By default,
the input syntax is guessed from the file extension,
and output is written in NTriples or NQuads.
.Pp
.Nm
can be used to check for syntax errors,
convert from one syntax to another,
pretty-print documents,
or transform URIs and blank node IDs.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 3n
.It Fl B Ar base
Input base URI.
Relative URI references in the input will be resolved against this.
When the input is a file,
the URI of the file is automatically used as the base URI.
This option can be used to override that,
or to provide a base URI for input from stdin or a string.
.It Fl I Ar syntax
Set an input syntax or option.
May be given multiple times.
The case-insensitive
.Ar syntax
can be
.Cm NQuads ,
.Cm NTriples ,
.Cm TriG ,
.Cm Turtle ,
or an option:
.Bl -tag -width 3n
.It Cm lax
Tolerate invalid input where possible.
Warnings will be printed for syntax errors,
but parsing will attempt to continue.
Note that data may be lost when using this option!
.El
.It Fl O Ar syntax
Set an output syntax or option.
May be given multiple times.
The case-insensitive
.Ar syntax
can be
.Cm empty ,
.Cm NQuads ,
.Cm NTriples ,
.Cm TriG ,
.Cm Turtle ,
or an option:
.Bl -tag -width 3n
.It Cm ascii
Escape all non-ASCII characters.
.It Cm lax
Tolerate corrupt UTF-8 and write replacements.
.It Cm terse
Write terser output with fewer, longer lines.
.It Cm unqualified
Don't shorten URIs into CURIEs.
.It Cm unresolved
Don't make URIs relative.
.El
.Pp
The
.Cm empty
syntax suppresses the output,
so that only warnings and errors will be printed.
.It Fl b Ar bytes
I/O block size.
This is the number of bytes in a file that will be read or written at once.
The default is 4096, which should perform well in most cases.
Note that this only applies to files, standard input and output are always processed one byte at a time.
.It Fl c Ar prefix
Chop
.Ar prefix
from matching blank node IDs.
This is typically used to revert the effects of
.Fl p .
For example, with
.Ar prefix
.Dq doc01 ,
the blank node
.Li _:doc01b42
will be emitted as
.Li _:b42 .
.It Fl e
Eat input one character at a time, rather than a page at a time which is the default.
This is useful when reading from a pipe since output will be generated immediately as input arrives, rather than waiting until an entire page of input has arrived.
With this option one less page of memory is used, but likely with a performance penalty.
.It Fl f
Fast and loose URI mode:
preserve full URIs (without qualifying or making relative),
and pass prefixed names through as-is.
.It Fl h
Print the command line options.
.It Fl k Ar bytes
Parser stack size.
Parsing is performed using a pre-allocated stack for performance and security reasons.
By default, the stack is 512 KiB, which should be sufficient for most data.
This can be increased to support unusually structured data and huge literals,
or decreased to reduce overall memory requirements and reduce startup time.
.It Fl p Ar prefix
Add
.Ar prefix
to blank node IDs.
This can be used to avoid clashes between blank node IDs in input documents.
The effects can be reversed in a later run with
.Fl c .
For example, with
.Ar prefix
.Dq doc01 ,
the blank node
.Li _:b42
will be emitted as
.Li _:doc01b42 .
.It Fl q
Suppress all output except data.
.It Fl r Ar root
Keep relative URIs within a
.Ar root
URI.
This will avoid creating any relative URI references with leading path segments like
.Pa ../
that enter a parent of
.Ar root .
.Pp
For example,
if
.Pa /home/you/file.ttl
is written to the file
.Pa /home/me/output.ttl
using the destination's base URI,
then it could be written as
.Li <../you/file.ttl> .
Setting
.Fl r Li file:///home/me/
would prevent references from
.Dq escaping
like this,
so the above would instead be written as
.Li <file:///home/you/file.ttl> ,
since it can't be expressed relative to the root URI.
.Pp
This is useful for keeping relative references within some directory.
.It Fl s Ar string
Parse
.Ar string
as input.
.It Fl v
Display version information and exit.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
Errors and warnings are printed in color by default if the output is a terminal.
This can be overridden with environment variables:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width 14n
.It Ev NO_COLOR
If present (regardless of value), color is disabled.
.It Ev CLICOLOR
If set to 0, color is disabled.
.It Ev CLICOLOR_FORCE
If set to anything other than 0, color is forced on.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
exits with a status of 0, or non-zero if an error occurred.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bl -tag -width 3n
.It Pretty-print a document:
.Nm Fl o
.Ar turtle
.Pa file.ttl
>
.Pa out.ttl
.It Print only errors and discard the output:
.Nm Fl O
.Ar empty
.Pa input.ttl
